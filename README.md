# 🥘🏃‍♀️: ECSE428 Gourmet Guru Project: Team 99

## Project Overview

  As future software engineers, we are tasked with building a weekly meal planner app called Gourmet Guru! Gourmet Guru will allow its users to create and share recipes. Other users can then search for recipes that other users have made and add them to their weekly meal plan. With recipes added to their meal plan, users will then be able to create a grocery list by selecting days in which recipes have been added. 
  
  A better you is a Gourmet Guru! 🪴
